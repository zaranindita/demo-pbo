# Simple Spring Boot Note Application

This is a basic Spring Boot application that allows users to add and view notes via a web interface.

## Changes Made

The recent updates to this project involved:

1.  **Added `spring-boot-starter-web` Dependency:** The `pom.xml` file was updated to include the necessary dependency for building web applications with Spring Boot.
2.  **Restructured Source Code:** The Java source files (`NoteController.java`, `Note.java`, `NoteRepository.java`) were moved into the standard `src/main/java/com/example/demo/` package structure.
3.  **Added Frontend:** An `index.html` file was added to `src/main/resources/static/` to provide a simple user interface.

## Why It Didn't Work Before

The previous version of the application likely failed to run correctly due to one or both of the following reasons:

1.  **Missing Web Dependency:** Without the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency, the application lacked the necessary components (like an embedded Tomcat server and Spring MVC) to function as a web application.

2.  **Incorrect Package Structure:** Spring Boot relies on component scanning to automatically detect beans like controllers, repositories, and entities. By default, it scans the package of the main application class (`com.example.demo` in this case) and its sub-packages. The previous file structure might have placed these components outside the scannable packages, preventing Spring Boot from finding and managing them.

## Folder Structure

### Before

```
demo/
├── pom.xml
└── src/
    └── main/
        ├── controller/              # <-- Incorrect location
        │   └── NoteController.java
        ├── model/                   # <-- Incorrect location
        │   └── Note.java
        ├── repository/              # <-- Incorrect location
        │   └── NoteRepository.java
        └── resources/
            └── application.properties
            # Missing static/index.html
```
*(Note: This structure placed Java source files outside the standard `src/main/java` and package structure, preventing Spring Boot's component scan from finding them.)*

### After

```
demo/
├── pom.xml
└── src/
    ├── main/
    │   ├── java/
    │   │   └── com/
    │   │       └── example/
    │   │           └── demo/
    │   │               ├── DemoApplication.java
    │   │               ├── controller/
    │   │               │   └── NoteController.java
    │   │               ├── model/
    │   │               │   └── Note.java
    │   │               └── repository/
    │   │                   └── NoteRepository.java
    │   └── resources/
    │       ├── application.properties
    │       └── static/
    │           └── index.html
    └── test/
        └── java/
            └── com/
                └── example/
                    └── demo/
                        └── DemoApplicationTests.java
```

These changes ensure the application has the required web capabilities and that Spring Boot can correctly identify and wire together the application components.
